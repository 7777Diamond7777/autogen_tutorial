As a result, Silvergate announced voluntary liquidation and stated that it would return all deposited funds to their respective owners. The failure of Silvergate Bank was part of the larger 2023 United States banking crisis, which also saw the failure of Signature Bank, another bank with significant exposure to cryptocurrency. The Federal Reserve and other federal bank regulators announced measures to ensure that deposits at other banks, such as Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, would be honored in response to these failures.

      "Silvergate Bank failed on March 8, 2023. The bank faced financial constraints and had to sell assets at a loss. To maintain liquidity, Silvergate borrowed $3.6 billion from the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco. However, the bank risked losing its status as a well-capitalized bank and faced risks related to its ability to continue operating. As a result, Silvergate announced voluntary liquidation and stated that it would return all deposited funds to their respective owners. The failure of Silvergate Bank was part of the larger 2023 United States banking crisis, which also saw the failure of Signature Bank, another bank with significant exposure to cryptocurrency.
