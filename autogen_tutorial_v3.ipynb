The country\\'s own contracting economy also posed a challenge to its meeting of the convergence criteria. While keen on euro adoption, one month before Croatia\\'s EU entry, governor Vujčić stated \"...we have no date (to join the single currency) in mind at the moment\".', 'On 7 December, Croatia and the European Commission signed a Partnership Agreement for the organisation of information and communication campaigns concerning the changeover from the kuna to the euro in Croatia.In November 2021, the Croatian right-wing and eurosceptic party Hrvatski Suverenisti was unable to obtain the required number of signatures to force a referendum to block the planned adoption of the euro.On 10 December 2021, Finance Minister Marić announced that the bill on introducing the euro currency in Croatia was being drafted and could be outlined in mid-January, with its final adoption expected in April 2022.', \"Croatia adopted the euro as its currency on 1 January 2023, becoming the 20th member state of the eurozone. A fixed conversion rate was set at 1 € = 7.5345 kn.Croatia's previous currency, the kuna, used the euro (and prior to that one of the euro's major predecessors, the German mark or Deutsche Mark) as its main reference since its creation in 1994, and a long-held policy of the Croatian National Bank was to keep the kuna's exchange rate with the euro within a relatively stable range.Croatia's European Union (EU) membership obliged it to introduce the euro once it had fulfilled the euro convergence criteria.\", 'Parliament supported the report of Siegfried Mureșan that Croatia has fulfilled all the criteria for adopting euro on 1 January 2023.On 12 July 2022, the Council of EU adopted the final three legal acts that were required for Croatia to adopt the euro as legal tender. A fixed exchange rate was set at 1 € = 7.53450 kn.\\nOn 18 July 2022, the Croatian Mint began producing euro coins with Croatian national motifs.From 5 September 2022 until 31 December 2023, display of all prices in dual currency is mandatory to prevent unjustified price increases. The public can buy euro starter kits to familiarise themselves with the new currency starting 1 December 2022.', 'This had to be at least two years after Croatia joined the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM II), in addition to it meeting other criteria. Croatia joined ERM II on 10 July 2020. Prime Minister Andrej Plenković stated in November 2020 that Croatia intended to adopt the euro on 1 January 2023, and in December 2020 the Croatian government adopted an action plan for euro adoption.Many small businesses in Croatia had debts denominated in euros before EU accession. Croatians already used the euro for most savings and many informal transactions. Real estate, motor vehicle and accommodation prices were mostly quoted in euros.', \"The official decision for euro adoption is made by the EU's ECOFIN council and could not occur prior to 10 July 2022, two years after Croatia joined the ERM II.On 1 June 2022, the Commission assessed in its 2022 convergence report that Croatia fulfilled all the criteria for joining the euro area and proposed to the Council that Croatia adopt the euro on 1 January 2023.On 16 June 2022, the euro area member states recommended that Croatia become the 20th member. Paschal Donohoe, President of the Eurogroup said:\\n\\nI am very pleased to announce that the Eurogroup agreed today that Croatia fulfils all the necessary conditions to adopt the euro.\", 'While keen on euro adoption, one month before Croatia\\'s EU entry, governor Vujčić stated \"...we have no date (to join the single currency) in mind at the moment\". The European Central Bank (ECB) was expecting Croatia to be approved for ERM II membership in 2016 at the earliest, with euro adoption in 2019.In April 2015, President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović stated in a Bloomberg interview that she was \"confident that Croatia would introduce the euro by 2020\", although the then-Prime Minister Zoran Milanović subsequently refused to commit to such timeline for the euro adoption.In November 2017, Prime Minister Andrej Plenković said that Croatia aimed to join ERM II by 2020 and to introduce the euro initially by 2025.', \"== Background ==\\nCroatia's EU membership obliged it to join the eurozone once it fulfilled the euro convergence criteria.

He restated his confidence Croatia would be ready to enter the euro area from the start of 2023. In September 2021, following the meeting of the Eurogroup in Slovenia, Croatia signed an official agreement (a Memorandum of Understanding) with the European Commission and eurozone member states on practical steps for the actual minting of Croatian euro coins.\", \"In 2023, everyone would be able to exchange kunas for euros free of charge in banks, in the Croatian Post offices, and in financial services and payment systems branches.On 13 May 2022, the Croatian Parliament voted in favour of the proposal to introduce the euro as legal tender.In May 2022, the European Commission completed an assessment of Croatia's progress.\", 'The letter marked the first formal step towards the adoption of the euro. Croatia committed to joining the Banking union of the European Union as part of its efforts to join ERM II. On 23 November 2019, European Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis said that Croatia could join ERM II in the second half of 2020.Croatia joined ERM II on 10 July 2020.

However, the last of the five economic convergence criteria which need first to be complied with in order to qualify for euro adoption, is the exchange rate stability criterion, which requires having been an ERM-member for a minimum of two years without the presence of \"severe tensions\" for the currency exchange rate.', 'The government agreed that if it was re-elected in 2017 then it would agree a roadmap for adoption by 2020, however the election was lost to Andrej Babiš who had been against euro adoption in the near-term. Babiš\\'s successor Petr Fiala and his cabinet, formed after the 2021 legislative election, maintained the predecessor cabinets\\' intention not to adopt the euro, calling the adoption \"disadvantageous\" for the Czechs.\\n\\n\\n=== Denmark ===\\n\\nDenmark has pegged its krone to the euro at €1 = DKK 7.46038 ± 2.25% through the ERM II since it replaced the original ERM on 1 January 1999.', 'As of October 2022, there are approximately 420 million euro coins minted with the Croatian national motif.\\n\\n\\n== Design ==\\n\\n\\n== Impact ==\\nThe Croatian Ministry of Finance estimated the cost of the changeover from the kuna to the euro to be around 2 billion kuna. Government analysis indicates that most of the cost would be on the loss of the conversion business by the banking system, which is expected to lead to a rise in other banking fees. There is a possibility of a general price increase for consumers, with a simultaneous general currency conversion risk for most debtors.', 'This new design was approved by the Council of the European Union on 20 April.On 18 July 2022, the Croatian Mint officially began the production of the euro coins with the Croatian national motif. Workers were set to have three shifts until the end of 2022.On 1 September 2022, euro banknotes began being distributed to all banks in Croatia.On 1 October 2022, the newly minted euro coins had begun distribution to all banks in Croatia.On 20 October 2022, the executive board of the European Central Bank (ECB) adopted a Decision on the application of minimum reserves by the ECB following the introduction of the euro in Croatia on 1 January 2023.From 15 December 2022 to 15 January 2023, there were no charging fees for cash withdrawals from ATMs to clients of other banks.A transitional period for the imposing of minimum requirements on institutions located in Croatia took place from 1 January to 7 February 2023.', \"On 18 July 2022, the Croatian Mint began producing euro coins with Croatian national motifs.\\n\\n\\n== Public opinion ==\\nPublic support for the euro in Croatia\\n\\n\\n== Convergence status ==\\nIn its first assessment under the convergence criteria in May 2014, the country satisfied the inflation and interest rate criteria, but did not satisfy the public finances, ERM membership, and legislation compatibility criteria.

      "Croatia officially adopted the euro as its currency on 1 January 2023. Here are the steps and key points leading up to the adoption:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Croatia's EU Membership: Croatia's entry into the European Union (EU) on 1 July 2013 obliged the country to eventually adopt the euro once it fulfilled the euro convergence criteria.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Croatian National Bank's Plans: The Croatian National Bank had initially anticipated euro adoption within two or three years of EU entry, but external factors delayed the process.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Economic Challenges: Croatia's own contracting economy and the EU's response to the financial crises in the eurozone posed challenges to meeting the convergence criteria.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Euro Adoption Timeline: In November 2020, Prime Minister Andrej Plenković announced that Croatia intended to adopt the euro on 1 January 2023. The Croatian government adopted an action plan for euro adoption in December 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Joining ERM II: Croatia joined the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM II) on 10 July 2020. This step was necessary as part of the euro adoption process.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Convergence Criteria: Croatia had to fulfill various convergence criteria, including inflation, interest rate stability, public finances, compatibility with eurozone legislation, and participation in ERM II for at least two years without severe tensions in the exchange rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. EU Assessments: In June 2021, the European Commission proposed that Croatia adopt the euro on 1 January 2023. In June 2022, the Commission's convergence report concluded that Croatia satisfied all the criteria for adopting the euro.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Formal Decisions: The EU's ECOFIN council and the European Council supported Croatia's euro adoption proposal. On 12 July 2022, the final three legal acts required for adoption were adopted. The European Parliament also approved Croatia's entry into the eurozone on 5 July 2022.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. Currency Conversion: The exchange rate was fixed at 1 euro = 7.53450 Croatian kuna. From 5 September 2022 until 31 December 2023, displaying prices in dual currency (kuna and euro) became mandatory.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. Coin and Banknote Production: The Croatian Mint started producing euro coins with Croatian national motifs on 18 July 2022. Euro banknotes began distribution to banks in Croatia on 1 September 2022.\n",
      "\n",
      "11. Public Awareness and Support: The government conducted information and communication campaigns to educate the public about the changeover. Public support for euro adoption in Croatia has been positive.\n",
      "\n",
      "12. Completion of Adoption: On 1 January 2023, Croatia became the 20th member state of the eurozone, with the kuna no longer in circulation. The official conversion rate was set, and the process of exchanging kunas for euros in banks, post offices, and financial services branches began.\n",
