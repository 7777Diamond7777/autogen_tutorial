      "{'text': ['The Croatian National Bank had anticipated euro adoption within two or three years of EU entry. However, the EU\\'s response to the financial crises in eurozone delayed Croatia\\'s adoption of the euro. The country\\'s own contracting economy also posed a challenge to its meeting of the convergence criteria. While keen on euro adoption, one month before Croatia\\'s EU entry, governor Vujčić stated \"...we have no date (to join the single currency) in mind at the moment\".', 'This had to be at least two years after Croatia joined the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM II), in addition to it meeting other criteria. Croatia joined ERM II on 10 July 2020. Prime Minister Andrej Plenković stated in November 2020 that Croatia intended to adopt the euro on 1 January 2023, and in December 2020 the Croatian government adopted an action plan for euro adoption.Many small businesses in Croatia had debts denominated in euros before EU accession. Croatians already used the euro for most savings and many informal transactions. Real estate, motor vehicle and accommodation prices were mostly quoted in euros.', \"Croatia adopted the euro as its currency on 1 January 2023, becoming the 20th member state of the eurozone. A fixed conversion rate was set at 1 € = 7.5345 kn.Croatia's previous currency, the kuna, used the euro (and prior to that one of the euro's major predecessors, the German mark or Deutsche Mark) as its main reference since its creation in 1994, and a long-held policy of the Croatian National Bank was to keep the kuna's exchange rate with the euro within a relatively stable range.Croatia's European Union (EU) membership obliged it to introduce the euro once it had fulfilled the euro convergence criteria.\", 'On 7 December, Croatia and the European Commission signed a Partnership Agreement for the organisation of information and communication campaigns concerning the changeover from the kuna to the euro in Croatia.In November 2021, the Croatian right-wing and eurosceptic party Hrvatski Suverenisti was unable to obtain the required number of signatures to force a referendum to block the planned adoption of the euro.On 10 December 2021, Finance Minister Marić announced that the bill on introducing the euro currency in Croatia was being drafted and could be outlined in mid-January, with its final adoption expected in April 2022.', 'While keen on euro adoption, one month before Croatia\\'s EU entry, governor Vujčić stated \"...we have no date (to join the single currency) in mind at the moment\". The European Central Bank (ECB) was expecting Croatia to be approved for ERM II membership in 2016 at the earliest, with euro adoption in 2019.In April 2015, President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović stated in a Bloomberg interview that she was \"confident that Croatia would introduce the euro by 2020\", although the then-Prime Minister Zoran Milanović subsequently refused to commit to such timeline for the euro adoption.In November 2017, Prime Minister Andrej Plenković said that Croatia aimed to join ERM II by 2020 and to introduce the euro initially by 2025.', \"The official decision for euro adoption is made by the EU's ECOFIN council and could not occur prior to 10 July 2022, two years after Croatia joined the ERM II.On 1 June 2022, the Commission assessed in its 2022 convergence report that Croatia fulfilled all the criteria for joining the euro area and proposed to the Council that Croatia adopt the euro on 1 January 2023.On 16 June 2022, the euro area member states recommended that Croatia become the 20th member. Paschal Donohoe, President of the Eurogroup said:\\n\\nI am very pleased to announce that the Eurogroup agreed today that Croatia fulfils all the necessary conditions to adopt the euro.\", 'Parliament supported the report of Siegfried Mureșan that Croatia has fulfilled all the criteria for adopting euro on 1 January 2023.On 12 July 2022, the Council of EU adopted the final three legal acts that were required for Croatia to adopt the euro as legal tender. A fixed exchange rate was set at 1 € = 7.53450 kn.\\nOn 18 July 2022, the Croatian Mint began producing euro coins with Croatian national motifs.From 5 September 2022 until 31 December 2023, display of all prices in dual currency is mandatory to prevent unjustified price increases. The public can buy euro starter kits to familiarise themselves with the new currency starting 1 December 2022.', 'Paschal Donohoe, President of the Eurogroup said:\\n\\nI am very pleased to announce that the Eurogroup agreed today that Croatia fulfils all the necessary conditions to adopt the euro.\\nOn 24 June 2022, the European Council supported the Commission\\'s proposal for Croatia to adopt the euro. \"It endorses the Commission\\'s proposal that Croatia adopt the euro on January 1, 2023 and invites the EU\\'s ECOFIN council to adopt swiftly the relevant Commission proposals,\" the Council added.On 5 July 2022, the European Parliament approved Croatia\\'s entry in eurozone with 539 votes in favour, 45 against and 48 abstentions.', \"== Background ==\\nCroatia's EU membership obliged it to join the eurozone once it fulfilled the euro convergence criteria.
